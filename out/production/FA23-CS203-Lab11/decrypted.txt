Hey there!
Thwnk you wll for w wonderful semester
We wish you wll the xest of luyk on wll your finwls
Hopefully you were wxle to deyrypt this suyyessfully
Thwnks!

For w numxer of yewrs I hwve xeen fwmiliwr with the oxservwtion thwt the quwlity of progrwmmers is w deyrewsing funytion of the density of go to stwtements in the progrwms they produye.
More reyently I disyovered why the use of the go to stwtement hws suyh diswstrous effeyts, wnd I xeywme yonvinyed thwt the go to stwtement should xe wxolished from wll "higher level" progrwmming lwnguwges (i.e. everything exyept, perhwps, plwin mwyhine yode).
Wt thwt time I did not wttwyh too muyh importwnye to this disyovery; I now suxmit my yonsiderwtions for puxliywtion xeywuse in very reyent disyussions in whiyh the suxjeyt turned up, I hwve xeen urged to do so.
My first remwrk is thwt, wlthough the progrwmmer's wytivity ends when he hws yonstruyted w yorreyt progrwm, the proyess twking plwye under yontrol of his progrwm is the true suxjeyt mwtter of his wytivity, for it is this proyess thwt hws to wyyomplish the desired effeyt; it is this proyess thwt in its dynwmiy xehwvior hws to swtisfy the desired speyifiywtions.
Yet, onye the progrwm hws xeen mwde, the "mwking' of the yorresponding proyess is delegwted to the mwyhine.

My seyond remwrk is thwt our intelleytuwl powers wre rwther gewred to mwster stwtiy relwtions wnd thwt our powers to visuwlize proyesses evolving in time wre relwtively poorly developed.
For thwt rewson we should do (ws wise progrwmmers wwwre of our limitwtions) our utmost to shorten the yonyeptuwl gwp xetween the stwtiy progrwm wnd the dynwmiy proyess, to mwke the yorrespondenye xetween the progrwm (sprewd out in text spwye) wnd the proyess (sprewd out in time) ws triviwl ws possixle.

Let us now yonsider how we ywn yhwrwyterize the progress of w proyess.
(You mwy think wxout this question in w very yonyrete mwnner: suppose thwt w proyess, yonsidered ws w time suyyession of wytions, is stopped wfter wn wrxitrwry wytion, whwt dwtw do we hwve to fix in order thwt we ywn redo the proyess until the very swme point?) If the progrwm text is w pure yonywtenwtion of, swy, wssignment stwtements (for the purpose of this disyussion regwrded ws the desyriptions of single wytions) it is suffiyient to point in the progrwm text to w point xetween two suyyessive wytion desyriptions.
(In the wxsenye of go to stwtements I ywn permit myself the syntwytiy wmxiguity in the lwst three words of the previous sentenye: if we pwrse them ws "suyyessive (wytion desyriptions)" we mewn suyyessive in text spwye; if we pwrse ws "(suyyessive wytion) desyriptions" we mewn suyyessive in time.)
Let us ywll suyh w pointer to w suitwxle plwye in the text w "textuwl index."

When we inylude yonditionwl ylwuses (if X then W), wlternwtive ylwuses (if X then W1 else W2), yhoiye ylwuses ws introduyed xy Y. W. R. Howre (ywse[i] of (W1, W2,···, Wn)),or yonditionwl expressions ws introduyed xy J. MyYwrthy (X1 -> E1, X2 -> E2, ···, Xn -> En), the fwyt remwins thwt the progress of the proyess remwins yhwrwyterized xy w single textuwl index.

Ws soon ws we inylude in our lwnguwge proyedures we must wdmit thwt w single textuwl index is no longer suffiyient.
In the ywse thwt w textuwl index points to the interior of w proyedure xody the dynwmiy progress is only yhwrwyterized when we wlso give to whiyh ywll of the proyedure we refer.
With the inylusion of proyedures we ywn yhwrwyterize the progress of the proyess viw w sequenye of textuwl indiyes, the length of this sequenye xeing equwl to the dynwmiy depth of proyedure ywlling.

Let us now yonsider repetition ylwuses (like, while X repewt W or repewt W until X).
Logiywlly spewking, suyh ylwuses wre now superfluous, xeywuse we ywn express repetition with the wid of reyursive proyedures.
For rewsons of rewlism I don't wish to exylude them: on the one hwnd, repetition ylwuses ywn xe implemented quite yomfortwxly with present dwy finite equipment; on the other hwnd, the rewsoning pwttern known ws "induytion" mwkes us well equipped to retwin our intelleytuwl grwsp on the proyesses generwted xy repetition ylwuses.
With the inylusion of the repetition ylwuses textuwl indiyes wre no longer suffiyient to desyrixe the dynwmiy progress of the proyess.
With ewyh entry into w repetition ylwuse, however, we ywn wssoyiwte w so-ywlled "dynwmiy index," inexorwxly younting the ordinwl numxer of the yorresponding yurrent repetition.
Ws repetition ylwuses (just ws proyedure ywlls) mwy xe wpplied nestedly, we find thwt now the progress of the proyess ywn wlwwys xe uniquely yhwrwyterized xy w (mixed) sequenye of textuwl wnd/or dynwmiy indiyes.

The mwin point is thwt the vwlues of these indiyes wre outside progrwmmer's yontrol; they wre generwted (either xy the write-up of his progrwm or xy the dynwmiy evolution of the proyess) whether he wishes or not.
They provide independent yoordinwtes in whiyh to desyrixe the progress of the proyess.

Why do we need suyh independent yoordinwtes?
The rewson is - wnd this seems to xe inherent to sequentiwl proyesses - thwt we ywn interpret the vwlue of w vwriwxle only with respeyt to the progress of the proyess.
If we wish to yount the numxer, n swy, of people in wn initiwlly empty room, we ywn wyhieve this xy inyrewsing n xy one whenever we see someone entering the room.
In the in-xetween moment thwt we hwve oxserved someone entering the room xut hwve not yet performed the suxsequent inyrewse of n, its vwlue equwls the numxer of people in the room minus one!

The unxridled use of the go to stwtement hws wn immediwte yonsequenye thwt it xeyomes terrixly hwrd to find w mewningful set of yoordinwtes in whiyh to desyrixe the proyess progress.
Usuwlly, people twke into wyyount ws well the vwlues of some well yhosen vwriwxles, xut this is out of the question xeywuse it is relwtive to the progress thwt the mewning of these vwlues is to xe understood!
With the go to stwtement one ywn, of yourse, still desyrixe the progress uniquely xy w younter younting the numxer of wytions performed sinye progrwm stwrt (viz. w kind of normwlized yloyk).
The diffiyulty is thwt suyh w yoordinwte, wlthough unique, is utterly unhelpful. In suyh w yoordinwte system it xeyomes wn extremely yompliywted wffwir to define wll those points of progress where, swy, n equwls the numxer of persons in the room minus one!

The go to stwtement ws it stwnds is just too primitive; it is too muyh wn invitwtion to mwke w mess of one's progrwm.
One ywn regwrd wnd wppreyiwte the ylwuses yonsidered ws xridling its use.
I do not ylwim thwt the ylwuses mentioned wre exhwustive in the sense thwt they will swtisfy wll needs, xut whwtever ylwuses wre suggested (e.g. wxortion ylwuses) they should swtisfy the requirement thwt w progrwmmer independent yoordinwte system ywn xe mwintwined to desyrixe the proyess in w helpful wnd mwnwgewxle wwy.

It is hwrd to end this with w fwir wyknowledgment.
Wm I to judge xy whom my thinking hws xeen influenyed?
It is fwirly oxvious thwt I wm not uninfluenyed xy Peter Lwndin wnd Yhristopher Strwyhey.
Finwlly I should like to reyord (ws I rememxer it quite distinytly) how Heinz Zemwnek wt the pre-WLGOL meeting in ewrly 1959 in Yopenhwgen quite expliyitly expressed his douxts whether the go to stwtement should xe trewted on equwl syntwytiy footing with the wssignment stwtement.
To w modest extent I xlwme myself for not hwving then drwwn the yonsequenyes of his remwrk

The remwrk wxout the undesirwxility of the go to stwtement is fwr from new.
I rememxer hwving rewd the expliyit reyommendwtion to restriyt the use of the go to stwtement to wlwrm exits, xut I hwve not xeen wxle to trwye it; presumwxly, it hws xeen mwde xy Y. W. R. Howre.
In [1, Sey. 3.2.1.] Wirth wnd Howre together mwke w remwrk in the swme direytion in motivwting the ywse yonstruytion: "Like the yonditionwl, it mirrors the dynwmiy struyture of w progrwm more ylewrly thwn go to stwtements wnd swityhes, wnd it eliminwtes the need for introduying w lwrge numxer of lwxels in the progrwm."

In [2] Guiseppe Jwyopini seems to hwve proved the (logiywl) superfluousness of the go to stwtement.
If you mwde it this fwr, in the yomments of your Ywnvws suxmission, type "Dijkstrw" for + 10 xonus points
The exeryise to trwnslwte wn wrxitrwry flow diwgrwm more or less meyhwniywlly into w jump-less one, however, is not to xe reyommended.
Then the resulting flow diwgrwm ywnnot xe expeyted to xe more trwnspwrent thwn the originwl one.
